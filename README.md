## Installation and Setup
1. First, make sure you have Python and Pipenv installed on your system.
2. Install Pipenv by running the following command.
3. Next, navigate to your project directory and create the Pipenv virtual environment and install project dependencies.
4. Now, activate the Pipenv virtual environment and run your project scripts.


```bash
$ pip install pipenv
$ cd help_python
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```
Please note that these instructions serve as an example, and you should modify them based on your own project's requirements and settings. Additionally, if your project has specific dependency configurations, you can include those in the Pipfile and refer to it in the "Installation and Setup" section of your README.md file.
